Successfully completed a POC to reuse types generated from API definitions: This project streamlined API integration by reducing the manual work of writing API types and keeping front-end developers in sync with API changes, significantly saving time and improving efficiency. This major task was successfully delivered with valuable guidance from Piotr and Agnieszka.


Collaborated on developing the new joiners portal website for the PPTLS crew: I worked with Pravanshu, focusing on two key modules. This project helped refresh my React JS skills and was my first assigned development task. I will also maintain the portal whenever any changes are required.


Worked on UWR library update stories: During this work, I gained a better understanding of Keylink UI components and the Keylink front-end code structure. I aim to focus more on improving my front-end skills and plan to learn the complete structure.


Participated in Reverse Polish Notation challenge by Piotr: This task is still under review. I received feedback on my initial changes to improve the solution.


Attended technical and financial trainings: These trainings helped broaden my knowledge and improve my understanding of both technical and financial aspects relevant to my role.
