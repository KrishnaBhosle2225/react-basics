I see a great opportunity to deepen my knowledge of front-end development, particularly in React JS and TypeScript, to contribute more effectively to the ongoing project.

I plan to network with more colleagues and industry professionals and contribute more meaningfully to the team.

I aim to become more impactful in the development field by consistently expanding my technical skills, taking on more challenging tasks, and proactively identifying areas where I can add value to the team.

I am focused on improving my communication skills to explain technical concepts more clearly and collaborate better with team members
