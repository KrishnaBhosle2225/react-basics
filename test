8. Open to Feedback: "I listened to feedback to improve my work. I’ll keep this up by asking for feedback regularly and making adjustments to grow faster."


Subject: Proposal to Implement API Generator in Keytrader

Hi [ABC’s Name],

I wanted to share a quick overview of the API Generator we’ve developed and recently deployed in the Keylink product—and also explore the possibility of implementing it in the Keytrader repository as well.

Problem Statement:

Currently, whenever backend developers introduce API changes, front-end developers have to manually sync those changes into the front-end codebase. This manual step is time-consuming and error-prone.

Solution:

To streamline this process, we’ve built an API Generator tool that automates the sync between backend and frontend.

Highlights:
	1.	The API Generator fetches the latest API versions from Nexus and converts the API specification files (YAML) into TypeScript interfaces and enums.
	2.	These generated types and enums are automatically made available in the front-end repository.
	3.	This ensures front-end developers always have access to the latest API definitions without any manual work.

Benefits:
	•	Reduced manual effort, freeing up developer time.
	•	Faster development cycles with real-time API updates.
	•	Improved collaboration between frontend and backend teams.

You can check out the project here:
API Generator Repository

Next Steps:

I’d like to explore the idea of implementing this API Generator in your Keytrader repository. Let me know if your team would be open to adopting it.

Also, I’d be more than happy to give you a live demo of how it works for better understanding.

Looking forward to your thoughts!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
